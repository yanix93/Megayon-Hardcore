					<p>The Dakbayan sa Pagadian is the capital of Zamboanga del Sur. Of yore, and history Pagadian was well remembered as a sitio of Margosatubig (Pearl-upon-the-Waters). However, after some local district changes it has become a component city. The Subanon, a peaceful tribe, living along the riverbanks amidst the hinterlands, may be considered as the first inhabitants of the city.
Throughout each waking Pagadianon’s lives, We have pondered on how to effectively express the essence of Pagadian, a city that holds great cultural significance. Drawing from our personal experiences, as well as the perspectives of the people we have encountered, one central theme consistently emerges - the Subanen tribe.
This indigenous group has played a vital role in shaping the identity of Pagadian, making it a place of rich heritage and culture. As a result, the celebration of Megayon Festivity (est. 2001), and the proclamation of Megayon Park. Further, “Megayon” is a Subanen word for unity — especially among the tripartite Subanen lumads, Muslims, and Christian local settlers. When you lay eyes on the emblem of Pagadian, you will be greeted by the image of the Subanen shield. It is fascinating to note we still know the people who contributed to the significance of this emblem; a symbol deeply connected to our city. The Subanen shield serves as a solidified representation of Pagadian's central theme, embodying the spirit of the indigenous tribe.
Furthermore, our city proudly hosts a festival known as "Megayon," exclusive to Pagadian and the entirety of Zamboanga del Sur. A quick search on Google will affirm that the name "Megayon" is synonymous with Pagadian. This festival encapsulates the essence of our community, bringing forth the values of unity, inclusivity, and support among the tripartite and solidarity. It celebrates our identity, showcasing the unique aspects that make us who we are. With the hardcore ethos, We have witnessed first-hand in major cities on comparison of Pagadian's essence revolves around brotherhood, strength, lifestyle, and a do-it-yourself (DIY) community. "Megayon  Hardcore" emerges as a platform that not only embraces these hardcore principles and ethos but also promotes them. It acts as a catalyst for unity and solidarity, encouraging individuals to celebrate their heritage while forming a strong bond with one another.
By adopting "Megayon Hardcore" as a concept, we pave the way for promoting identity and heritage. It becomes a unifying force that rallies the community, encouraging individuals to embrace their roots and preserve the rich cultural tapestry that defines us. Through this movement, we can ensure that the legacy of the Subanen tribe and the unique spirit of Pagadian live on for future generations to embrace and cherish.
In conclusion, "Megayon Hardcore" is a testament to the intrinsic value of identity and heritage. By weaving together the threads of our collective experiences, it becomes a symbol of unity, strength, and brotherhood.
Let us embrace this concept not only as a means of self-expression but also as a way to preserve the cultural legacy deeply ingrained within us. Together, we can propel Pagadian into a future where our identity and heritage shine brightly for all to see.
DIY for life,
Megayon HC</p>
